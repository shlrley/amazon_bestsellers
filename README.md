### **Tips For Data Wrangling**
1. Use `ast.literal_eval()` to convert columns with lists (but that are string type) to list type so that you can explode the dataframe (similar to what was done in assignmnent 5) 

```
df['goodreads_genres'] = df.goodreads_genres.apply(lambda s: list(ast.literal_eval(s)))
```

2. Instead of tip 1, read the dataframe from the pickle file (i.e use `pd.read_pickle()` instead of `pd.read_csv()`) - this will convert the column type from a string to a list automatically 

```
df = pd.read_pickle('amazon_conlit_goodreads_nyt.pkl')
```

** This dataset is not perfect and there may be some incorrect matches (i.e the paperback version of a book in the amazon bestsellers may have been matched with a hardcover in the goodreads dataset etc., so be wary of columns such as price or publish date)
